  <h1>Searching for Words</h1>
  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;Search</tt> from the main menu to create a new Search
  tab.  A Search tab can be used to find all acceptable words that match
  certain conditions within a lexicon.  The lexicon and conditions are
  specified in the top part of the Search tab, and the resulting list of words
  is displayed in the bottom area.  Initially only a single search condition
  is displayed.  Add more conditions by clicking any button containing a plus
  sign.  Remove a condition from the list by clicking the button with a minus
  sign next to the condition to be removed.  When the search conditions are
  correct, click the <i>Search</i> button to perform a search.</p>
  <a name="search-conditions">
  <h2>Search Conditions</h2>
  <p>The available search conditions are described below.  Any number of each
  type of condition can be specified in a single search.</p>
  <a name="anagram-match">
  <h3>Anagram Match</h3>
  <p>The <i>Anagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the search
  pattern can be matched in any order.  All the letters must be matched
  exactly the number of times they appear in the match pattern.  Special
  wildcard characters can be used to match any letters: the <tt>?</tt>
  character means "match any single letter" and the <tt>*</tt> character means
  "match any number of letters".  The <tt>*</tt> character also matches
  nothingness.  Multiple wildcard characters can be used in a single pattern.
  The <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> characters can also be used to specify a set
  of letters that can be matched.  Here are some examples of <i>Anagram
  Match</i> conditions:</p>
  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE, TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AENORST</tt></td><td><tt>ATONERS, SANTERO, SENATOR,
  TREASON</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ETX?</tt></td><td><tt>EXIT, NEXT, SEXT, TEXT,
  VEXT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>PI??Z</tt></td><td><tt>PIZZA, PRIZE, SPITZ, UNZIP,
  ZIPPY</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>Z[AEIOU][AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>AZO, ZEE, ZOA,
  ZOO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*JBX</tt></td><td><tt>JAMBEAUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Note that with an <i>Anagram Match</i> condition, using more than one
  <tt>*</tt> character has the same effect as using just one.</p>
  <a name="pattern-match">
  <h3>Pattern Match</h3>
  <p>The <i>Pattern Match</i> condition means that the search pattern must be
  matched exactly, in the same order the letters are specified.  The same
  special wildcard characters can be used as described in the <a
  href="#anagram-match">Anagram Match</a> section.  Here are some examples of
  <i>Pattern Match</i> conditions:</p>
  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT?</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, ATT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT??</tt></td><td><tt>ATAP, ATES, ATMA, ATOM,
  ATOP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>T?P</tt></td><td><tt>TAP, TIP, TOP, TUP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>A[JQXZ]?</tt></td><td><tt>AXE, AZO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>[AEIOU]D[AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>ADO, ODE, UDO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>TO*P</tt></td><td><tt>TOP, TOECAP, TOSSUP, TOUCHUP, TOYSHOP,
  TOWNSHIP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*WM</tt></td><td><tt>CWM, SHAWM</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>?W*M?S</tt></td><td><tt>SWAMIS, SWAMPS, TWASOMES, TWOSOMES,
  TWELVEMOS</tt></td></tr>
  </table>
  <a name="subanagram-match">
  <h3>Subanagram Match</h3>
  <p>The <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the
  search pattern can be matched in any order, and not all letters must be used
  in each matching word.  The same special wildcard characters can be used as
  described in the <a href="#anagram-match">Anagram Match</a> section.  Here
  are some examples of <i>Subanagram Match</i> conditions:</p>
  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>AE, AT, ET, TA, ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE,
  TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX?</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, EL, EX, LA, LI, LO, OX, XI, XU,
  LAX, LEX, LOX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX[AU]</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, LA, XU, LAX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Note that with an <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition, using a <tt>*</tt>
  character will cause the pattern to match every acceptable word.</p>
  <a name="word-length">
  <h3>Length</h3>
  <p>A minimum and maximum word length can be specified for the results of a
  search.  For example, if the minimum length is 4 and the maximum length is
  6, then the search will only return results that are between four and six
  letters long.  To specify minimum or maximum length, choose the
  <i>Length</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values
  appropriately.  An exact length can also be specified by making the
  <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>
  <a name="in-lexicon">
  <h3>In Lexicon</h3>
  <p>The <i>In Lexicon</i> condition specifies an additional lexicon that each
  word must belong to.  Only words in the specified lexicon will appear in the
  search results.  If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, only words
  <i>not</i> in the additional lexicon will appear in the search results.</p>
  <p>The <i>In Lexicon</i> condition is a convenient way to find differences
  between two lexicons.  For example, to find all the 3-letter words that were
  added to the OWL2 lexicon, and do not appear in the OWL lexicon, do a search
  within the OWL2 lexicon with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 3, Max 3, and
  a negated <i>In Lexicon</i> condition of OWL.  In order for this search to
  work correctly, both the OWL2 and OWL lexicons must be loaded.</p>
  <a name="in-word-list">
  <h3>In Word List</h3>
  <p>The <i>In Word List</i> condition specifies a list that each word must
  belong to.  Only words in the word list will appear in the search results.
  If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, only words <i>not</i> in the word
  list will appear in the search results.</p>
  <p>To create a word list, click the <i>Edit List</i> button.  A window will
  appear, allowing a word list to be read from a file.  To read a word list
  from a file, click the <i>Open File</i> button and select the file
  containing the word list.  A word list file is expected to have one word per
  line.  Words from more files can be included by clicking the <i>Open
  File</i> button multiple times.  The word list can be cleared by clicking
  the <i>Clear</i> button.</p>
  <p>When the word list is complete, click the <i>OK</i> button.  The search
  area will display the number of words in the list.</p>
  <a name="belongs-to-group">
  <h3>Belongs to Group</h3>
  <p>The <i>Belongs to Group</i> condition specifies special sets that each
  word must belong to.  Currently there are a few sets provided:</p>
  <p><b>Hook words.</b> The <i>Hook Words</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first or last letter.  For
  example, <tt>SHILL</tt> is a hook word, because the word <tt>HILL</tt> can
  be formed by removing its first letter.</p>
  <p><b>Front hooks.</b> The <i>Front Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first letter.  For example,
  <tt>AGAZE</tt> is a front hook, because the word <tt>GAZE</tt> can be formed
  by removing its first letter.</p>
  <p><b>Back hooks.</b> The <i>Back Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the last letter.  For example,
  <tt>VIGA</tt> is a back hook, because the word <tt>VIG</tt> can be formed by
  removing its last letter.</p>
  <p><b>High Fives.</b> The <i>High Fives</i> set consists of 5-letter
  words beginning or ending with F, H, K, V, W, or Y.  High Fives also do not
  contain J, Q, X, or Z.</p>
  <p><b>Type I Sevens.</b> The <i>Type I Sevens</i> set consists of 7-letter
  words containing a <a href="credits.html#bingo-stems">6-letter bingo
  stem</a> in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>AIRIEST</tt> is a Type I Seven because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>
  <p><b>Type II Sevens.</b> The <i>Type II Sevens</i> set consists of 7-letter
  words consisting entirely of the letters in
  <tt>AAADEEEEGIIILNNOORRSSTTU</tt>, but not belonging to the <i>Type I
  Sevens</i> set.  This distribution of letters represents each letter that
  appears at least three times in the total letter distribution of some
  popular word games, plus an extra S because the S can be such a valuable
  letter.  For example, <tt>ADAGIAL</tt> is a Type II Seven because its
  letters are entirely within the set of letters described above, but it is
  not a Type I Seven.</p>
  <p><b>Type III Sevens.</b> The <i>Type III Sevens</i> set consists of
  7-letter words that have at least a certain probability, but do not belong
  to either the <i>Type I Sevens</i> or <i>Type II Sevens</i> set.  For a word
  to be a Type III Seven, its probability must be greater than or equal to the
  probability of the word <tt>HUNTERS</tt>.  For example, <tt>ABALONE</tt> is
  a Type III Seven, because its probability is greater than <tt>HUNTERS</tt>,
  but it is not a Type I Seven nor a Type II Seven.</p>
  <p><b>Type I Eights.</b> The <i>Type I Eights</i> set consists of 8-letter
  words containing a <a href="credits.html#bingo-stems">6-letter bingo
  stem</a> in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>SEXTARII</tt> is a Type I Eight because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>
  <p><b>Type II Eights.</b> The <i>Type II Eights</i> set consists of 8-letter
  words consisting entirely of the letters in
  <tt>AAADEEEEGIIILNNOORRSSTTU</tt>, but not belonging to the <i>Type I
  Eights</i> set.  This distribution of letters represents each letter that
  appears at least three times in the total letter distribution of some
  popular word games, plus an extra S because the S can be such a valuable
  letter.  For example, <tt>ADENOSES</tt> is a Type II Eight because its
  letters are entirely within the set of letters described above, but it is
  not a Type I Eight.</p>
  <p><b>Type III Eights.</b> The <i>Type III Eights</i> set consists of
  7-letter words that have at least a certain probability, but do not belong
  to either the <i>Type I Eights</i> or <i>Type II Eights</i> set.  For a word
  to be a Type III Eight, its probability must be greater than or equal to the
  probability of the word <tt>NOTIFIED</tt>.  For example, <tt>ABOIDEAU</tt>
  is a Type III Eight, because its probability is greater than
  <tt>NOTIFIED</tt>, but it is not a Type I Eight nor a Type II Eight.</p>
  <p><b>Eights From Seven-Letter Stems.</b> The <i>Eights From Seven-Letter
  Stems</i> set consists of 8-letter words containing a
  <a href="credits.html#bingo-stems">7-letter bingo stem</a> in
  the top 100 stems.  For example, <tt>AZOTISED</tt> is an Eight From
  Seven-Letter Stems because it contains the bingo stem <tt>TOADIES</tt>,
  which is in the top 100 stems.</p>
  <a name="num-vowels">
  <h3>Number of Vowels</h3>
  <p>A minimum and maximum number of vowels (A, E, I, O, U) can be specified
  for the results of a search.  For example, if the minimum number of is 1 and
  the maximum is 2, then the search will only return words that have one or
  two vowels.</p>
  <p>To specify minimum or maximum number of vowels, choose the <i>Number of
  Vowels</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values
  appropriately.  An exact number of vowels can also be specified by making
  the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>
  <a name="includes-letters">
  <h3>Includes Letters</h3>
  <p>The <i>Includes Letters</i> condition specifies letters that must be
  included in each word in the search results.  This is most useful if you
  want to specify a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition with wildcard characters,
  and want the wildcards to match certain letters in an unspecified order.</p>
  <p>For example, to find all 7- and 8-letter words beginning with
  <tt>OVER</tt> and containing the letters <tt>A</tt>, <tt>L</tt>, and
  <tt>T</tt> in any order, do the following.  Specify a <i>Pattern Match</i>
  condition of <tt>OVER*</tt>, a <i>Minimum Length</i> condition of 7, a
  <i>Maximum Length</i> condition of 8, and a <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition of <tt>ALT</tt>.  This search will find the words
  <tt>OVERLATE</tt>, <tt>OVERSALT</tt>, and <tt>OVERTALK</tt>.</p>
  <p>If a letter appears multiple times in a <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition, the letter must appear at least that many times in each word in
  the search results.</p>
  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, then the <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition specifies letters that must not be included in the search results.
  This is most useful for generating special word lists, such as the list of
  words containing the letter Q but not the letter U.  To find such words,
  specify a <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of <tt>Q</tt> and a negated
  <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of <tt>U</tt>.  This search will find all
  the words containing Q but not U.</p>
  <a name="probability-order">
  <h3>Probability Order</h3>
  <p>A <i>Probability Order</i> search condition can be used to find words
  having a certain probability order relative to other words of the same
  length.  For example, to find the 1000 most probable 7-letter words, create
  a search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 7, Max 7, and a
  <i>Probability Order</i> condition of Min 1, Max 1000.  To find all 8-letter
  words containing Z that are also among the 1000 most probable 8-letter
  words, create a search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 8, Max 8, an
  <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of Z, and a <i>Probability Order</i>
  condition of Min 1, Max 1000.  In OWL2, there are two such words: NOTARIZE
  and TRIAZOLE.</p>
  <p>The <i>Blanks</i> selection area specifies the number of blanks used to
  calculate the probability value. The available options are 0, 1, or 2.</p>
  <p>If the <i>Lax</i> checkbox is activated, the search will also find all
  words that have equal probability as the minimum or maximum of the range.
  For example, in OWL2, a search for <tt>Length: Min 7, Max 7</tt>,
  <tt>Probability Order: Min 7, Max 8 (Lax)</tt> will find 10 words, whose
  probability orders are 1 through 10.  This is because all the 7-letter words
  with probability order 1-7 have the same probability, as do all the words
  with probability order 8-10.  The <i>Lax</i> checkbox allows them all to be
  found although their unique probability orders are not strictly between 7
  and 8.</p>
  <a name="limit-by-probability-order">
  <h3>Limit by Probability Order</h3>
  <p>A <i>Limit by Probability Order</i> search condition can be used to limit
  the search results to a certain range of words in order of probability.  For
  example, to find the 50 most probable 7-letter words containing V, create a
  search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 7, Max 7, an <i>Includes
  Letters</i> condition of V, and a <i>Limit by Probability Order</i>
  condition of Min 1, Max 50.</p>
  <p>The <i>Limit by Probability Order</i> condition is applied last, after
  all other search conditions.  So for example, in the search mentioned above,
  Zyzzyva first finds all 7-letter words containing V.  Then it finds the
  words ranked 1-50 out of that list.</p>
  <a name="playability-order">
  <h3>Playability Order</h3>
  <p>A <i>Playability Order</i> search condition can be used to find words
  having a certain playability order (as calculated by John O'Laughlin)
  relative to other words of the same
  length.  For example, to find the 1000 most playable 7-letter words, create
  a search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 7, Max 7, and a
  <i>Playability Order</i> condition of Min 1, Max 1000.  To find all 8-letter
  words containing X that are also among the 1000 most playable 8-letter
  words, create a search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 8, Max 8, an
  <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of X, and a <i>Playability Order</i>
  condition of Min 1, Max 1000. In OWL2, there are four such words:
  ANOREXIA, RETAXING, EXERTION, and EXORDIAL.</p>
  <p>If the <i>Lax</i> checkbox is activated, the search will also find all
  words that have equal playability as the minimum or maximum of the range.
  For example, in OWL2, a search for <tt>Length: Min 7, Max 7</tt>,
  <tt>Playability Order: Min 4000, Max 4000 (Lax)</tt> will find two words,
  CORDAGE and ADVECTS. The <i>Lax</i> checkbox allows them both to be
  found although only the unique playability order of ADVECTS is strictly
  4000. The word CORDAGE has the same playability value, but its unique
  playability order is 3999.</p>
  <a name="limit-by-playability-order">
  <h3>Limit by Playability Order</h3>
  <p>A <i>Limit by Playability Order</i> search condition can be used to limit
  the search results to a certain range of words in order of playability.  For
  example, to find the 50 most playable 7-letter words containing V, create a
  search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 7, Max 7, an <i>Includes
  Letters</i> condition of V, and a <i>Limit by Playability Order</i>
  condition of Min 1, Max 50. To find the 50 most playable words of any length
  between 2 and 8 containing V, simply change the <i>Length</i> condition to
  Min 2, Max 8.</p>
  <p>The <i>Limit by Playability Order</i> condition is applied last, after
  all other search conditions.  So for example, in the search mentioned above,
  Zyzzyva first finds all 7-letter words containing V.  Then it finds the
  words ranked 1-50 out of that list.</p>
  <a name="num-unique-letters">
  <h3>Number of Unique Letters</h3>
  <p>A minimum and maximum number of unique letters can be specified
  for the results of a search.  For example, if the minimum number of is 3 and
  the maximum is 5, then the search will only return words that have between
  three and five unique letters.</p>
  <p>To specify minimum or maximum number of unique letters, choose the
  <i>Number of Unique Letters</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and
  <i>Max</i> values appropriately.  An exact number of unique letters can also
  be specified by making the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each
  other.</p>
  <a name="point-value">
  <h3>Point Value</h3>
  <p>A minimum and maximum point value can be specified for the results of a
  search.  For example, if the minimum number of is 8 and the maximum is 10,
  then the search will only return words that have a total point value between
  8 and 10.  The point value of a word is determined by adding the individual
  point values of its letters.  The value of each letter is the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A = 1</li>
  <li>B = 3</li>
  <li>C = 3</li>
  <li>D = 2</li>
  <li>E = 1</li>
  <li>F = 4</li>
  <li>G = 2</li>
  <li>H = 4</li>
  <li>I = 1</li>
  <li>J = 8</li>
  <li>K = 5</li>
  <li>L = 1</li>
  <li>M = 3</li>
  <li>N = 1</li>
  <li>O = 1</li>
  <li>P = 3</li>
  <li>Q = 10</li>
  <li>R = 1</li>
  <li>S = 1</li>
  <li>T = 1</li>
  <li>U = 1</li>
  <li>V = 4</li>
  <li>W = 4</li>
  <li>X = 8</li>
  <li>Y = 4</li>
  <li>Z = 10</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The point value of each letter is considered even if a word must normally
  be formed using a blank.  For example, the point value of ZYZZYVA is 43 (10
  + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1), not 23 (10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1).</p>
  <p>To specify minimum or maximum point value, choose the <i>Point Value</i>
  condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values appropriately.  An
  exact point value can also be specified by making the <i>Min</i> and
  <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>
  <a name="prefixes-suffixes">
  <h3>Prefixes and Suffixes</h3>
  <p>There are two conditions for specifying that search results must take or
  not take certain prefixes or suffixes.</p>
  <p>The <i>Takes Prefix</i> condition specifies that every search result must
  also form a valid word when the specified prefix is added.  For example, if
  a <i>Takes Prefix</i> condition of <tt>PRE</tt> is specified in conjunction
  with a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition of <tt>VAL*</tt>, the word VALENCE
  will be found because PREVALENCE is also valid.  However, the word VALID
  will not be found because PREVALID* is not a valid word.</p>
  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, the meaning of the <i>Takes
  Prefix</i> condition is exactly reversed.  In the previous example, the word
  VALID would appear in the search results because it does <i>not</i> take
  <tt>PRE</tt> as a prefix, and VALENCE would not appear, because it
  <i>does</i> take <tt>PRE</tt> as a prefix.</p>
  <p>The <i>Takes Suffix</i> condition specifies that every search result must
  also form a valid word when the specified suffix is added.  For example, if
  a <i>Takes Suffix</i> condition of <tt>S</tt> is specified in conjunction
  with a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition of <tt>*ING</tt>, the word MOLDING
  will be found because MOLDINGS is also valid.  However, the word KICKING
  will not be found because KICKINGS* is not a valid word.</p>
  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, the meaning of the <i>Takes
  Suffix</i> condition is exactly reversed.  In the previous example, the word
  KICKING would appear in the search results because it does <i>not</i> take
  <tt>S</tt> as a suffix, and MOLDING would not appear, because it <i>does</i>
  take <tt>S</tt> as a suffix.</p>
  <a name="consists-of">
  <h3>Consists of</h3>
  <p>The <i>Consists of</i> condition specifies letters that must occur with a
  certain frequency.  This is useful for generating special word lists, such
  as the list of words containing at least 70% vowels.  To find such words,
  specify a <i>Consists of</i> condition, putting <tt>70</tt> in the
  <i>Min</i> numeric area, <tt>100</tt> in the <i>Max</i> numeric area, and
  <tt>AEIOU</tt> in the input box.</p>
  <a name="num-anagrams">
  <h3>Number of Anagrams</h3>
  <p>A minimum and maximum number of anagrams can be specified for the results
  of a search.  For example, if the minimum length is 2 and the maximum is 4,
  then the search will only return words that have between two and four
  anagrams.  A word is considered to be an anagram of itself, so every valid
  word has at least one anagram.</p>
  <p>To specify minimum or maximum number of anagrams, choose the <i>Number of
  Anagrams</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values
  appropriately.  An exact length can also be specified by making the
  <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>
  <a name="part-of-speech">
  <h3>Part of Speech</h3>
  <p>The <i>Part of Speech</i> condition searches for words that have a
  particular part of speech associated with them. For this search to work, the
  lexicon database must contain definitions including parts of speech. For
  example, the definition "<tt>rough, cindery lava [n -S]</tt>" specifies a word with
  <i>Noun</i> part of speech because it is listed as "n" inside square
  brackets.</p>
  <p>There are ten available parts of speech that can be searched. Here is how
  each part of speech must be listed in the word definitions:</p>
  <table cellpadding="5px">
  <tr><td><b>Part of Speech</b></td><td><b>Definition Format</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Adjective</td><td><tt>adj</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Adverb</td><td><tt>adv</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Conjunction</td><td><tt>conj</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Definite Article</td><td><tt>definite_article</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Indefinite Article</td><td><tt>indefinite_article</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Interjection</td><td><tt>interj</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Noun</td><td><tt>n</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Preposition</td><td><tt>prep</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pronoun</td><td><tt>pron</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Verb</td><td><tt>v</tt></td></tr>
  </table>
  <a name="definition">
  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p>The <i>Definition</i> condition searches for words that have definitions
  matching the search. For this search to work, the lexicon database must
  contain definitions. Currently no wildcard characters are allowed. Only
  literal matches can be searched.</p>
  <a name="load-save-search">
  <h2>Loading and Saving Searches</h2>
  <p>It can be inconvenient to create complicated searches from scratch each
  time, especially if the same search is used often.  For this reason, Zyzzyva
  allows you to save searches and load them again later.  Anywhere that you
  can create a search (for example, in the Search tab or the New Quiz window),
  there is a <i>Save Search</i> button.  After creating the desired search
  conditions, click the <i>Save Search</i> button to save them.  A window will
  appear to allow you to save the search to a file.</p>
  <p>Later, if you want to repeat the same search you saved, you can click the
  <i>Load Search</i> button.  A window will appear to allow you to select the
  saved search file.  After choosing the file, the saved search conditions
  will appear in the search specification area just as if they had been
  entered from scratch.</p>
  <p>When saving a search, only the search specification is saved.  The words
  found by the search are not saved.  This allows for flexibility in
